# Basic Escrow dApp

To run the dapp:

1. Make sure you have the metamask extension installed.
2. Open up a code editor and git clone this repo.
3. run npm install to install all the dependencies.
4. run npx hardhat compile to compile the smart contract.
5. run npm start to open the react app in browser.
6. select an arbiter, a beneficiary, and a value for the contract to hold in escrow.
7. make sure your metamask is on a test network, then click create contract. connect whichever account you'd like to provide the "money"
8. once deployed, click "release" and connect whichever account was input as arbiter. If you don't do that it won't work. Thats like, the point.
